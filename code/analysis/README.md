Here the different systems are analyzed. Code to check parameter dependences and dump the data is located here. The folders are zipped for convenience.

For the following files the output was an array of lifetime for all the configurations as well as the total number of times that a convention got changed for particular settings. Effectively, here we study how long-lived a convention is for certain parameters.

For 1D nearest-neighbour system:
1D model - test - history.zip      - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on different vaues of memory
1D model - test - samples.zip      - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on how many samples are probed
1D model - test - probability.zip  - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on what is the probability of mistake. Repeated for                                        several values of memory.

For 2D randomly-connected system:
2D-random-test-friend number.zip   - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on the number of other agents being consulted.
2D-random-test-history.zip         - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on different values of memory
2D-random-test-samples.zip         - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on how many samples are probed
2D-random-test-probability.zip     - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on what is the probability of mistake. Repeated for                                        several values of memory.

For 2D nearest-neighbour square lattice system:
2D-NN-test-history.zip             - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on different values of memory
2D-NN-test-samples.zip             - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on how many samples are probed
2D-NN-test-probability.zip         - Analysis of how lifetimes depend on what is the probability of mistake. Repeated for                                        several values of memory.

For the following files, we analyzed how the probability of global convention depends on the connectivity. The output is effectively the probability of how likely two local different conventions are to merge into a global convention depending on the connectivity.

2D-NN-networks.zip                 - Analysis of how likely is a local convention to become a global convention.
